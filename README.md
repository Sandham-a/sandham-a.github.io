# Design

## Design Choices
When designing the website, I was consciously aware that the previous bootstrap project was a portfolio website and would need to be very distinct from my own website. The website is designed to show case my various IT skills it would have to be clear, concise and look professional.

## Colour
As dark blue is my favourite colour, I decided that would be the central colour as to base my website on. I used shecodes pallets which give me a pallet of complementary colours that work together and the hexadecimal values for the pallet of my choosing 

## Fonts
Pinyon script with cursive as fallback was used for the logo to match the sign outside the restaurant. Montserrat was used for the body and Roboto for headings. Both fonts are considered dyslexia friendly.

## Structure
As stated before I was very aware of the previous project being a portfolio website 
- A homepage with a sections for News and Sunday Meal Offers
- An about page with the About Us and Meet the Chef
- A menu page
- A image gallery with images and video showcasing the general feel of the restaurant
- A contact page with a contact form, a map and information about the bussines section
