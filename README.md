# Design

## Design Choices
When designing the website, I was consciously aware that the previous bootstrap project was a portfolio website and would need to be very distinct from my own website. The website is designed to show case my various IT skills it would have to be clear, concise and look professional.

## Colour
As dark blue is my favourite colour, I decided that would be the central colour as to base my website on. I used shecodes pallets which give me a pallet of complementary colours that work together and the hexadecimal values for the pallet of my choosing. 
![color scheme](docs/features/color-pallet.png)

## Fonts
I used exo font as it is a standard font for most corporate websites as it is clean and simple. The font is considered dyslexia friendly.

## Structure
As stated before I was very aware of the previous project being a portfolio website and needed to make sure that it did not look like a rehash of that. Having researched recommended portfolio sites
I decided to do a vertical header rather than a standard horizontal one for 3 reasons - 

1. The number of pages I needed mean that I doubted I'd come up with a layout that looked busy and cluttered. 
2. In the future with more time and when my skills have improved I can create collapsible subheadings to make navigation around the site even more precise. 
3. The layout means that the navigation of my site means that I can go to any page from any other page and that a users is only one click away from any page on the site.

The page is structured, uniform, intuitive and simple to pick up. 
The website consists of 7 pages

- An index page with a form to get in contact with me.
- A CV page that showcases my complete CV and allows for user interactivity with me highlighting the companies that I have worked for.
- A cloud computing page showcasing my cloud qualifications and plans to spin up a cloud server to launch this site in the future.
- A cyber security page explaining my educational background in cyber security, show the qualifications that I have and eventually and CTF articles that I write.
- A programming page that showcase little programming projects that I have done in the past. Eventually the links will run a modal that runs the program but this falls outside the scope of this project.
- A web development page that shows the websites that I have built or worked through. 
- A page for when a 404 error occurs.
